                            <p>The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be very steep and wet,<br> surrounded by shrubs and trees found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest,<br> rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy<br> forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows within its territory, using strong toes and claws.<br> Nest burrows, dug early in the season,<br> become overgrown at the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the female is ready to lay her eggs.</p>

                            <p>Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other and their chicks, and males purr during mating.<br> Pairs do fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she is not in the mood for his company.<br> If another kiwi invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis have been known to fight to the death, although this is rare.<br>
                                An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a female may choose a new male if a more desirable one wanders by.<br> The male doesn't have beautiful songs or fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows one around constantly while grunting.<br> If she's not interested, the female might wander off or try to scare him away.
                                Breeding season is late winter to early summer.<br> Nests might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug by the male.
                                The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year.<br> Kiwi eggs are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in color. They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg<br> might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that would be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving birth to a<br>  24-pound (11 kilograms) baby! Compared to the relative weights of other birds and their eggs,<br> the female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms) rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 kilograms).</p>
